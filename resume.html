          I currently manage the penetration testing team at Yahoo in NYC. I perform penetration testing, and vulnerability research in both proprietary and open source software. While at Yahoo I also developed and published the Yahoo security vulnerability disclosure policy and worked closely with industry peers to respond to the Wassenaar Intrusion Software export controls.<br><br>

          I founded Leaf SR in 2011, a boutique consulting service backed by original security research. My responsibilities include source code audits, penetration testing, reverse engineering, training, and handling all aspects of the business. I have performed security audits for many customers with a real world focus and the goal of helping them improve the security of increasingly complex software. I developed a unique training course titled “Advanced C/C++ Source Code Analysis” which I delivered at Black Hat USA and private customers.
          <br><br>
          My technical background centers around vulnerability research and exploit development. My experience includes source code audits, reverse engineering and fuzzing on targets ranging from desktop applications, embedded game consoles, mobile devices to smart meters. My non-technical experience includes people management, principal consultant and mentor, managing customer relationships, launching internal research initiatives, and founder.
          <br><br>
          I've been a full time developer where I wrote code for an intrusion detection and prevention software on the OpenBSD platform for a UTM device. Part of this work required modifying the kernel pf subsystem to do inline packet hooking from user space long before it was officially supported.
          <br><br>
          I started my career supporting the US Army CERDEC in the Information Assurance Division.
          <br><br>
          I've been invited to give talks on the topic of software security and past research that I've published. I guest lectured at NYU Poly in Brooklyn NY and I've been published in IEEE ‘Security and Privacy’ magazine. I also sit on the Black Hat content review board.
