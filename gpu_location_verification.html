          There is no debating the value of high end AI compute to economic growth and national security. The Chip Security Act proposes
          some interesting ideas for how to prevent the diversion of high end AI compute to adversarial nations. One of these proposals
          is the implementation of location verification mechanisms for high end chips. I have <a href="https://struct.github.io/hardware_exc.html">previously 
          explored</a> the topic on this blog. However, the policy environment has shifted considerably since then: Chinese firms such as DeepSeek have made rapid advances 
          in large scale model development, a new U.S. administration has reframed the strategic objectives of AI export controls, and Congress has introduced the 
          Chip Security Act as a legislative means for embedding technical safeguards at the hardware level as one option for enforcing them.
          Given these changes, I thought it was time to revisit the topic and do a deeper technical analysis on the feasibility of implementing location 
          verification in high end chips along with some recommendations for policy makers. Below you can find the abstract of the paper and a link to download it.

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          Hardware enabled AI governance mechanisms have been proposed as a means for deterring and tracking the diversion of high end AI compute. Achieving this 
          will require combining remote attestation techniques with new technology and infrastructure.
          These new mechanisms will be the target of sustained research to break them by motivated and technically capable adversaries. We describe the types of components
          that would be required for building one potential solution in enough detail to consider the costs, timelines, and vulnerability to attack. We find that while the cost for
          building this system is low in relative terms, it requires access to cryptographic primitives and operations performed on chip that are not available today, but even
          with these new capabilities the system is unlikely to withstand persistent research eï¬€orts to defeat it by a capable adversary.
