      <section>
        <p>My name is <a href="mailto:chris.rohlf@gmail.com">Chris Rohlf</a>. I've been a <a href="resume.html">security researcher, developer, and engineer since 2003 at fine places such as Square, Yahoo, Leaf Security Research, Matasano Security, and US DoD</a>.<br><br>
        Root Cause is a space to post articles about computation at scale, programming languages, security/cryptography, and esoteric memory safety vulnerabilities. My hope is that these posts will be preserved for future generations to study what primitive human beings once considered complex machines.</p><br>

        <h3><div id='post7'><a href="attacker_attribution.html">The Value of Attacker Attribution</a></div></h3>
        <p>November 2nd, 2019 - I explored the value of attacker attribution by collecting data from 45 people in CISO and security leadership roles.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post7'><a href="mapguard.html">Map Guard and Intel MPK</a></div></h3>
        <p>July 28th, 2019 - A brief overview of the Map Guard library I published to github and how it uses Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK) to dynamically mark all code in a process as execute only.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post7'><a href="bytes_bombs_and_spies.html">Bytes, Bombs and Spies - Review</a></div></h3>
        <p>June 15th, 2019 - My review of 'Bytes, Bombs and Spies'. A quick recap of my thoughts on this collection of essays tackling the topic of strategic cyber offense. Originally posted on Dave Aitels CyberSecPolitics blog.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post7'><a href="cross_dso_cfi.html">Cross DSO CFI - LLVM and Android</a></div></h3>
        <p>January 1st, 2019 - I wanted to briefly explore cross DSO CFI implementations and whether targeting their fast path 'Shadow' allocations was possible as an exploitation technique (it's not).</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post6'><a href="oilpan_metadata.html">Chrome Oilpan - Meta Data, Freelists and more</a></div></h3>
        <p>April 7th, 2017 - In this article I briefly cover the internals and some weaknesses of OilPan, Google's Garbage Collected heap for Chrome.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post5'><a href="partition_alloc.html">Hardening PartitionAlloc</a></div></h3>
        <p>January 22, 2016 - In this article I dive into how PartitionAlloc works by first explaining its origins and how some of its basic allocation code paths work. I also introduce some basic hardening measures by randomizing the freelist and adding some basic double free protection.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post4'><a href="pdfium_partitionalloc.html">Porting PartitionAlloc To PDFium</a></div></h3>
        <p>September 9th, 2015 - In this brief article I explain how I ported the Chrome PDFium library to use the PartitionAlloc heap allocator. This brings the benefits of fine graned memory separation for objects allocated inside the PDFium code.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post3'><a href="openssl.html">My heart is OK but my eyes are bleeding</a></div></h3>
        <p>A quick look at the OpenSSL out of bounds read vulnerability from 2014. The internet went into panic mode and blamed the OpenSSL project for maintaining their own malloc. But this, like most things on the internet, was rooted in false assumptions.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post2'><a href="glibc_house_of_mind.html">Glibc 2.11 and the House of Mind</a></div></h3>
        <p>Originally posted in 2010 on my first blog, this article explores how ptmalloc2 in glibc 2.11 attempted to stop the obscure House of Mind heap exploitation technique.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><div id='post1'><a href="webkit_css.html">WebKit CSS Type Confusion</a></div></h3>
        <p>Originally posted in 2010 on my first blog, this article looks at an interesting type confusion vulnerability I discovered in WebKit. This was an extremely flexible vulnerability that allowed for an abitrary length read from an arbitrary address.</p>
